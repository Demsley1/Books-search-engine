  ## Description 

  Using a provided book search application, with restful api standards, I have refactored the code to use the popular graphql model instead.  The functioning applicaiton uses the google search api to look for any book inputed then allows the user to save the book to their account if logged in. Along with the graphql, and appollo client, I implemented the complimentary appollo server that allows the graphql to work on the backend. This project displays the benefits of learning multiple programs and libraries and how to use them to store, and retrieve data to serve front end functionality, by the seamless transition which required minimal change to fron end code and logic.
